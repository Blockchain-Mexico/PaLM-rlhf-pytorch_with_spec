## PaLM + RLHF - Pytorch (wip)

Implementation of RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) on top of the PaLM architecture. Maybe I'll add retrieval functionality too, Ã  la <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/RETRO-pytorch">RETRO</a>

## FAQ

- Does this contain a model for inference?

There is no trained model. This is just the ship and overall map. We still need millions of dollars of compute + data to sail to the correct point in high dimensional parameter space. Even then, you need professional sailors (like Robin Rombach of Stable Diffusion fame) to actually guide the ship through turbulent times to that point.

## Community

<a href="https://carper.ai/">CarperAI</a> had been working on <a href="https://github.com/CarperAI/trlx">an RLHF framework</a> for large language models for many months prior to the release of ChatGPT.

## Install

```bash
$ pip install palm-rlhf-pytorch
```

## Usage

First train `PaLM`, like any other autoregressive transformer

```python
import torch
from palm_rlhf_pytorch import PaLM

palm = PaLM(
    num_tokens = 20000,
    dim = 512,
    depth = 12
).cuda()

seq = torch.randint(0, 20000, (1, 2048)).cuda()

loss = palm(seq, return_loss = True)
loss.backward()

# after much training, you can now generate sequences

generated = palm.generate(2048) # (1, 2048)
```

Then train your reward model, with the curated human feedback. In the original paper, they could not get reward model to be finetuned from a pretrained transformer without overfitting, but I gave the option to finetune with `LoRA` anyways, since it is still open research.

```python
import torch
from palm_rlhf_pytorch import PaLM, RewardModel

palm = PaLM(
    num_tokens = 20000,
    dim = 512,
    depth = 12,
    causal = False
)

reward_model = RewardModel(
    palm,
    num_binned_output = 5 # say rating from 1 to 5
).cuda()

# mock data

seq = torch.randint(0, 20000, (1, 1024)).cuda()
prompt_mask = torch.zeros(1, 1024).bool().cuda() # which part of the sequence is prompt, which part is response
labels = torch.randint(0, 5, (1,)).cuda()

# train

loss = reward_model(seq, prompt_mask = prompt_mask, labels = labels)
loss.backward()

# after much training

reward = reward_model(seq, prompt_mask = prompt_mask)
```

Then you will pass your transformer and the rewards model to the `RLHFTrainer`

```python
import torch
from palm_rlhf_pytorch import PaLM, RewardModel, RLHFTrainer

# load your pretrained palm

palm = PaLM(
    num_tokens = 20000,
    dim = 512,
    depth = 12
).cuda()

palm.load('./path/to/pretrained/palm.pt')

# load your pretrained reward model

reward_model = RewardModel(
    palm,
    num_binned_output = 5
).cuda()

reward_model.load('./path/to/pretrained/reward_model.pt')

# ready your list of prompts for reinforcement learning

prompts = torch.randint(0, 256, (50000, 512)).cuda() # 50k prompts

# pass it all to the trainer and train

trainer = RLHFTrainer(
    palm = palm,
    reward_model = reward_model,
    prompt_token_ids = prompts
)

trainer.train(num_episodes = 50000)

# then, if it succeeded...
# generate say 10 samples and use the reward model to return the best one

answer = trainer.generate(2048, prompt = prompts[0], num_samples = 10) # (<= 2048,)
```

## Todo

- [x] clone base transformer with separate lora for critic
- [x] also allow for non-LoRA based finetuning
- [x] redo normalize to be able to have a masked version, not sure if anyone will ever use per token rewards / values, but good practice to implement

- [ ] add Hugging Face accelerate and test out wandb instrumentation
- [ ] search literature to figure out what is the latest SOTA for PPO, assuming RL field is still making progress.
- [ ] test the system using a pretrained sentiment network as reward model
- [ ] write the memory in PPO to memmapped numpy file
- [ ] get sampling with variable lengthed prompts working, even if it is not needed given bottleneck is human feedback
- [ ] allow for finetuning penultimate N layers only in either actor or critic, assuming if pretrained
- [ ] incorporate some learning points from Sparrow, given Letitia's video
- [ ] simple web interface with django + htmx for collecting human feedback
- [ ] equip with <a href="https://github.com/hazyResearch/flash-attention">the best attention</a>
- [ ] consider <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/constitutional.pdf">RLAIF</a>
