### Principles 

will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of your application.


## Engine

Using a custom engine can give you more control over the tokenization process, and can be especially useful for languages or domains that require specialized tokenization rules or algorithms

Boyer-Moore algorithm


## Tokenizer

Implement the tokenizer in a lower-level language such as C or Rust, and call it from Python using a language binding. This can improve the performance of the tokenizer and reduce the memory usage, especially if the tokenizer is a performance bottleneck in a larger system

Using a pre-trained tokenizer is a great way to optimize tokenization, especially for large datasets or complex languages


Design the hardware accelerator: The hardware accelerator needs to be designed specifically for tokenization. This involves creating a custom architecture that can efficiently tokenize text.

Implement the hardware design: The hardware design needs to be implemented in hardware using FPGAs, ASICs, or other custom hardware designs. This requires specialized knowledge in hardware design and verification.

Integrate the hardware accelerator: The hardware accelerator needs to be integrated with the existing software stack. This involves developing software drivers and APIs that can interact with the hardware accelerator.

Test and optimize the system: The system needs to be tested and optimized to ensure that it performs efficiently and accurately. This requires benchmarking the system and fine-tuning the hardware and software parameters.

Deploy the system: Once the system has been optimized and tested, it can be deployed in production. This requires ensuring that the system is reliable, secure, and scalable.


In terms of the tokenization process, the FPGA-based accelerator can take in the input text, tokenize it and produce the token to ID mappings and the sequence of token IDs. The software stack can then use the hardware accelerator to perform the tokenization and produce the required outputs.



## Decorder - Encoder

### Description

The encoder and decoder are implemented as classes with their own forward methods that perform the necessary computations. The encoder takes an input tensor and returns the final hidden state of the RNN cell. The decoder takes a hidden state and generates a sequence of outputs, one token at a time.
