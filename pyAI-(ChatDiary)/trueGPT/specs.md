Description

Data collection and preprocessing: Collect a large corpus of text data and preprocess it by tokenizing the text into words or subwords, converting the words to numerical representations (e.g., using one-hot encoding or word embeddings), and batching the data for training.

import os
import re

def load_data(data_dir):
data = []
for file in os.listdir(data_dir):
with open(os.path.join(data_dir, file), 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
text = f.read()
# split text into sentences
sentences = re.split('[.!?]', text)
# remove any leading/trailing whitespace from each sentence
sentences = [s.strip() for s in sentences]
data.extend(sentences)
return data

def preprocess_data(sentences):
# perform any necessary text cleaning or feature extraction
processed_data = []
for sentence in sentences:
# for example, we can remove any special characters and lowercase the text
sentence = re.sub('[^A-Za-z0-9]+', ' ', sentence).lower()
processed_data.append(sentence)
return processed_data

# example usage:
data_dir = 'path/to/data/directory'
sentences = load_data(data_dir)
processed_data = preprocess_data(sentences)


Preprocessing
Once we have collected the text data, we need to preprocess it in order to prepare it for use in a machine learning model. Here are some common preprocessing steps:

Tokenization: Split the text into individual words or tokens.
Lowercasing: Convert all text to lowercase to reduce the vocabulary size.
Stopword removal: Remove common words such as "the", "a", and "an" that don't carry much meaning.
Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base form, e.g. "running" to "run".


RNN architecture: Define the architecture of the RNN, including the number and type of layers (e.g., LSTM, GRU), the number of hidden units, and the initialization of the weights.

Training loop: Implement a training loop that iteratively feeds batches of data to the RNN, computes the loss using a cross-entropy loss function, and updates the model parameters using backpropagation through time.

Sampling: Implement a sampling function that generates new text by feeding a prompt to the RNN and using the model's predictions to sample the next word in the sequence.

Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the language model using metrics such as perplexity or human evaluation.
