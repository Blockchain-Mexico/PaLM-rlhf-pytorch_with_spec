Description

Data collection and preprocessing: Collect a large corpus of text data and preprocess it by tokenizing the text into words or subwords, converting the words to numerical representations (e.g., using one-hot encoding or word embeddings), and batching the data for training.

RNN architecture: Define the architecture of the RNN, including the number and type of layers (e.g., LSTM, GRU), the number of hidden units, and the initialization of the weights.

Training loop: Implement a training loop that iteratively feeds batches of data to the RNN, computes the loss using a cross-entropy loss function, and updates the model parameters using backpropagation through time.

Sampling: Implement a sampling function that generates new text by feeding a prompt to the RNN and using the model's predictions to sample the next word in the sequence.

Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the language model using metrics such as perplexity or human evaluation.
